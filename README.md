# Titanic_Dataset_EDA
This project provides a simple exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python. 
The goal is to understand patterns in passenger demographics, ticket classes, and survival outcomes.

# What’s Included
Data cleaning (missing values, basic preprocessing)
Visualizations of age, fare, gender, class, and survival
Key insights about factors affecting survival

# Tools Used
Python
pandas, numpy
matplotlib, seaborn

# Dataset
Kaggle Titanic Dataset (train.csv, test.csv)

# Key Insights (examples)
Females had significantly higher survival rates
Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive
Younger children had better survival outcomes
Fare and class showed strong correlation with survival
